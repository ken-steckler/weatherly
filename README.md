# Weatherly: Simply, a weather web-app

The purpose of this project is to quickly provide simple weather infromation

## Uses

Upon visitng the website, a short loading screen displays, followed by the actual website. The website will already show the current weather of your current location. It will also show the relative time, humidity, as well as when the sun will rise/set. The user can search by city name to retrieve the previously mentioned information for that particular city. This app is still a work in progress and will periodically update.

### Technolgies

React was used as the JavaScript library for this project. Separate components were used to display the weather information. API calls are made to Openweathermap.org (click <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">here</a> for more information). The app will automatically fetch the API call based on the user's current geolocation and will display the information.

Other languages used in this project include HTML and CSS.
